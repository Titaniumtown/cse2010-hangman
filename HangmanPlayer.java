  Description of the overall algorithm:

  Initialization:
  Ok so basically the program reads the `words.txt` file with a Buffered Reader.
  Then it puts all the words into a hashmaps of hashsets indexed by the length of the words.
  The hashmap is then turned into a 3d (so many dimentions wow) array of chars, the first index being the size, 2nd being word entry, 3rd being the character.
  The 3d array of chars is stored in `this.dictionary`
  The variable `this.masterCharCount` is produced by counting the character counts for each length words.

  Runtime:
  `this.charCount` is filled up by indexing `this.masterCharCount`. Same with `this.possibleWords` being filled up by `this.dictionary`.
  The next most probable character is determined by finding the largest number in `this.charCount` and returning it's index as a char.
  When a guess is made, EvalHangmanPlayer tells us if the guess was correct or not, we don't really use this information as it's faster to ignore it.
  When we get feedback, we set the `this.charCount[this.lastGuess]` to -1 so that word wouldn't ever be guessed again.
  Pruning of `this.possibleWords` is then done, removing all words that don't fit what is currently known about the word.
  When a word is removed from `this.possibleWords`, it's characters are decremented from `this.charCount` in order to further guide the character picking process
